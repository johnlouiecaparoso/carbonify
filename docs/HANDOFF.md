# Carbonify — Handoff (current state)

> ## 📍 Where we are — verified 2026-07-20 · role audit + hardening 2026-07-22
>
> **Feature-complete for the current product scope. The money path is hardened in code and verified against the live DB. Remaining work is mostly external, operational, or legal.**
>
> **The next step is the closed beta on PayMongo test keys** — see [SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md](SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md) (execution), [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) (what to test), and [UAT_TEST_SCRIPT.md](UAT_TEST_SCRIPT.md) (per-role scripts to hand to pilot users).
>
> Read [CARBONIFY_OVERVIEW.md](CARBONIFY_OVERVIEW.md) for the plain-language system map. Read [GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md](GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md) for the real-money launch gate.
>
> **Current build state:** build green, lint green, **681 tests green** (was 679 before the 2026-07-25 UX-consistency pass, 665 before the RLS-capture pass, 543 after 2026-07-22, ~313 before that). *Run the suite with `--no-file-parallelism` — the parallel happy-dom worker init flakes on Windows and reports "no tests"; it is an environment issue, not a real failure.*
>
> ### 🆕 2026-07-25 (UX pass) — dashboard/header/nav consistency + records compaction
>
> Cosmetic + IA polish across every role, on `feature-user-onboarding-ux`. No
> money-path or schema changes; all of it is Vue/CSS + navigation.
>
> - **One shared green header.** New [PageHeader.vue](../src/components/layout/PageHeader.vue)
>   (title / subtitle / optional icon / actions slot) now backs every signed-in
>   dashboard and console. ~30 views that hand-rolled their own banner — several of
>   which had *no* green header at all (System Config, KYB/AML/Privacy/Refunds, Role
>   Applications, Analytics, AI Assistant, Seller Earnings, Carbon Ledger, Offtakes,
>   Data Room, Investor/MRV/Farmer/Buyer, Cart, **Saved**, Orders, Reported problems,
>   Upgrade, Social) — were converted. Embedded panels (the verifier's tabs inside
>   Verifier Panel) were correctly left alone.
> - **Headers shrunk.** The banner was `2rem` padding + a 2–2.5rem title, eating the
>   viewport; every one is now `1.25rem` padding / `1.5rem` title / `0.95rem`
>   subtitle. A first rem-only pass missed three views whose titles used CSS tokens
>   (`var(--font-size-4xl)` — Retire, Profile, Verifier Panel); those are pinned too.
>   All banners resolve to the same `--primary-color` (#069e2d).
> - **Sidebar IA.** Dashboard + Explore (marketplace-led) are pinned to the top of
>   the sidebar for **every** role, with the role-specific workspace below
>   ([navigation.js](../src/constants/navigation.js)).
> - **Sidebar highlight bug fixed.** `isCurrent` used a naive prefix match, so
>   `/biomass/sell` lit **both** "Sell feedstock" and its parent "Biomass" (and
>   `/admin/users` lit "Admin Dashboard") — which read as "Sell feedstock takes me to
>   Biomass". Now the longest matching nav path wins
>   ([AppSidebar.vue](../src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue)); covered by a new test.
> - **Records compaction.** Portfolio holdings, Orders and Receipts render as a
>   compact, **vertically**-scrollable list (~60vh, ~4 cards) with a **See more /
>   Show less** toggle, so a long history no longer scrolls for pages. Portfolio
>   stats/breakdowns still compute over the full set. Audit Logs got the same
>   See-more treatment; User Management's table no longer clips its Actions column.
> - **"Watchlist" → "Saved"** in all user-facing copy (route/service/DB names and the
>   unrelated AML sanctions "watchlist" left intact).
> - **Carbon calculator hardened:** per-source inputs clamped to ≥ 0 (a negative in
>   one field was silently cancelling real emissions in the total), credit
>   pluralisation, and the Buy button disabled at zero.
>
> Follow-ups worth a cleanup pass: the six title-page views converted to PageHeader
> still carry orphaned `.page-title`/`.page-description` CSS (dead, harmless).
>
> ### 🆕 2026-07-25 — profile-fetch failure hardened, and the signup-trigger migration applied
>
> Follow-on to the 2026-07-23 auth audit, on `feature-user-onboarding-ux`. The
> signup-trigger migration below made a profile *always exist*; this pass fixes what
> the **client** did when a profile still couldn't be read, so the same invisibility
> that hid the original bug can't downgrade a signed-in user.
>
> - **No more silent role downgrade.** A profile fetch that times out, errors, or
>   returns an unreadable row previously reset the user to `general_user` with no
>   signal — an admin mid-session lost their admin UI/permissions until a reload
>   happened to succeed. The store now **preserves the last-known role**, flags the
>   failure, and recovers in the background
>   ([userStore.js](../src/store/userStore.js)).
> - **The background retry actually runs now.** `_retryProfileFetch` guarded on
>   `_profileFetchInProgress`, but it's called from *inside* the in-progress fetch,
>   so it returned immediately every time — dead code. It's on a dedicated
>   `_profileRetryInProgress` flag now.
> - **`createProfile` returns the full row, not an `{ id }` stub.** With the trigger
>   pre-creating every profile, the "already exists" path is now common; returning a
>   bare id made the store canonicalize `role` to `general_user` and render a blank
>   profile ([profileService.js](../src/services/profileService.js)).
> - **The failure is surfaced, not swallowed.** A new `profileFetchFailed` store flag
>   drives a global `profile-stale-banner` ([App.vue](../src/App.vue)) plus an ambient
>   pulsing dot on the avatar and a role-adjacent note in the account dropdown
>   ([Header.vue](../src/components/layout/Header.vue)). All clear automatically once a
>   profile loads.
> - **✅ `20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql` was applied to the live project on
>   2026-07-25** (§0.5). Note the trigger swallows its own INSERT errors by design (so
>   it can never block a signup) — meaning a future `profiles` constraint it can't
>   satisfy would fail *silently*; worth watching the Postgres logs / adding an alert
>   rather than relying on the `raise warning`.
>
> ### 🆕 2026-07-25 (later) — money-table RLS posture captured into version control (#13c closed)
>
> The last repo-side security-provability gap is closed. The money tables' RLS was
> **correct on live but existed nowhere in `supabase/migrations/`** (the four ledger
> tables predate version control), so a fresh staging/DR/local env rebuilt them
> *client-writable* and the repo could not *prove* the money path was locked.
>
> - **New migration [`20260725000100_capture_money_table_rls.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260725000100_capture_money_table_rls.sql)** captures the complete posture declaratively — write-lockdown + the four ledger tables' own-row SELECT policies + the two inventory tables' public reads — **reconciled against a live `pg_policies` dump** and **applied to live 2026-07-25**.
> - **A real bug was caught during reconciliation:** `wallet_transactions` is scoped through `account_id → wallet_accounts`, not a direct `user_id`; the migration was corrected to match live before finalizing.
> - **Two ways to prove it now:** [`supabase/diagnostics/money_table_rls_audit.sql`](../supabase/diagnostics/money_table_rls_audit.sql) (read-only, **0 findings** on live — run at pilot pre-flight) and [`src/test/services/moneyTableRls.test.js`](../src/test/services/moneyTableRls.test.js) (CI guard that trips if the migration is edited to reopen a hole).
> - The gated `supabase/cutover/lockdown_financial_writes.sql` is now **retired** (deleted) — its job is fully covered by the versioned migration; one source of truth.
>
> **Escrow (#14) decided the same day — Option B (method-gated hold).** Card
> settlements hold the seller's net ~7 days against chargebacks; GCash/Maya and
> wallet purchases release immediately. Implementation is **written and staged** as
> [`20260725000200_restore_escrow_hold_window.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260725000200_restore_escrow_hold_window.sql)
> — it reuses the existing escrow machinery (`escrow_holds`, `release_escrow`, the
> held-aware `refund_purchase`, the `held`/`available` split in
> `get_my_seller_balance`) and adds only the escrow branch in
> `process_marketplace_purchase`, a `release_matured_escrow()` batch releaser, and
> two configurable `app_settings` windows. **Not yet applied** — it rewrites the
> live settlement RPC, so it lands in the pilot pre-flight with a full reconcile-to-0
> check (rationale + apply plan in [ESCROW_DECISION.md](ESCROW_DECISION.md)). With
> both #13c and #14 resolved, the pre-live-keys *engineering* track is clear; the
> remaining go-live P0s are external (pentest, email-confirmation domain, the beta).
>
> ### 🆕 2026-07-23 — navigation moved to a sidebar; auth + role guards audited and fixed
>
> Two pieces of work, both on `feature-user-onboarding-ux`.
>
> **1. Navigation is now one grouped sidebar**, not three drifting menus. Signed-in
> users navigate from a persistent left sidebar ([AppSidebar.vue](../src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue));
> the header keeps only identity + alerts (cart, bell, avatar); the avatar menu is
> account-only. Every destination is declared once in
> [constants/navigation.js](../src/constants/navigation.js), so a page can no longer
> carry three different names on three surfaces (it did: "Buy credits" / "Marketplace",
> "Saved" / "Watchlist"). The three-line menu button sits next to the logo and also
> collapses the desktop rail; guests keep the old marketing header. The developer
> project list now collapses to one row per project, grouped by what the developer
> must do about each ([groupDeveloperProjects.js](../src/utils/groupDeveloperProjects.js)).
>
> **2. Login / register / role-guard audit — three access-control blockers fixed:**
>
> | Blocker | Was | Fix |
> |---|---|---|
> | Public marketplace unreachable | The guard's allowlist had lost `marketplace` + `project-detail`, so the signed-out header's own links bounced visitors to `/login` | Routes declare `meta.public`; a test forbids any route being neither public nor `requiresAuth` |
> | `super_admin` locked out of the whole app | `getRoleDefaultRoute` sent them to `/admin`, the guard's `===` refused them, → **infinite redirect** | One `canonicalizeRole()` mirrors the DB's `canonicalize_notification_role()`; `super_admin` → `admin` everywhere |
> | Non-buying roles could walk checkout | `/cart`, `/credit-portfolio`, `/watchlist`, `/sales`, `/kyc` had no role gate — only the cart *icon* was hidden | `disallowedRoles` on each, matching what the UI already claimed |
>
> Plus: registration now reports email-confirmation-pending and already-registered
> instead of always "Account created, sign in"; the unapproved-specialist login gate
> keys on `err.code` not a matched sentence and fails **open** on lookup error by
> design; logout no longer wipes theme/language/sidebar prefs (auth keys only); a
> parallel dead authorization path (`canAccessRoute` / `getRoutePermissions`) that
> disagreed with the real guards was removed; and a **verifier-panel crash on every
> mount** (`Cannot access 'auditRows' before initialization`, a TDZ hit in an
> `immediate` watcher) was fixed — found while sweeping every role's dashboard in a
> real browser.
>
> **The migration from this pass — [`20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql)
> — was applied to the live project on 2026-07-25** (§0.5). It guarantees every
> `auth.users` row gets a profile via a signup trigger, closing the gap where accounts
> created with email confirmation on silently landed with no profile (blank name,
> demoted to `general_user`). The client-side resilience follow-on is in the
> 2026-07-25 note above.
>
> ### 🆕 2026-07-22 — all five roles audited end to end
>
> Every role was walked against its own `docs/role-needs/` page. **Two findings
> repeated for all five:** the requirements doc badly understated what had already
> shipped, and each role carried exactly one structural bug that undercut its
> premise.
>
> | Role | Structural bug found | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | Developer | Progress tracker frozen at stage 3 of 5 — it was never passed issuance/listing state | fixed |
> | Verifier | The **Submitted** queue tab hid every first-time submission (tab matched `'submitted'`, create paths write `'pending'`) | fixed |
> | LGU | Endorsements were **unscoped nationwide** — nothing recorded which municipality an LGU governs | fixed |
> | Buyer | Permanent credit retirement had **no confirmation step** | fixed |
> | Admin | DPA request queue had an index, RLS and a worker — but **no reader** | fixed |
>
> Security posture moved substantially, all enforced **at the database** rather
> than in the UI: verifier independence, endorsement jurisdiction, account
> suspension, admin segregation of duties, and AML screening.
>
> Also fixed along the way: project verification decisions were writing **no audit
> rows at all**, and every resource-scoped audit reader queried columns that do not
> exist (`entity_type`/`entity_id`/`timestamp` vs `resource_type`/`resource_id`/
> `created_at`).
>
> ⚠️ **Six migrations from this pass are listed in §0.4 — apply them before relying
> on any of the above.** Several of these features are inert until their migration
> runs, and two of them (LGU jurisdiction, admin SoD) are *silently* inert: the UI
> works, the guard simply is not there.
>
> *2026-07-21 was a documentation-reconciliation pass only — no code, DB, or deploy change. It corrected stale "do this next" instructions that later entries in this same file had already superseded.*

## Current snapshot

- Carbonify is a Philippine carbon-credit registry and marketplace with role-based workflows for developers, verifiers, buyers, admins, and LGUs.
- The core product flow is in place: register -> validate -> MRV -> issue -> trade -> retire, and it has been run end-to-end against the live DB.
- The money path is server-authoritative: settlement is controlled by the backend, not the browser, and the financial tables are RLS-locked against client writes (**verified on live 2026-07-20**).
- `reconcile_financials()` returns **0 rows** on live — a clean baseline for the pilot.
- The most important remaining work is the pilot itself, then launch hardening, external integrations, and operations/legal readiness.

## Implemented now

- Auth, roles, router guards, and MFA/KYC/KYB gates.
- Project registration, MRV, verifier review, issuance, and QR-verifiable certificates.
- Marketplace, cart, wallet, retirement, receipts, seller earnings, payouts, and refunds/disputes.
- Public registry and market views, plus LGU and admin tooling.
- The seven expansion features (registry fields, carbon asset ledger, biomass marketplace, MRV dashboard, investor portal + data room, farmer portal); the AI assistant is interface-only.
- Developer docs, user guides, testing docs, deployment docs, and security docs.

## Not yet implemented or still external

**Gates before real money** (detail in [GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md](GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md) §5):
- **Independent penetration test** — the last P0 before live payment keys.
- **Email confirmation is OFF by choice** — anyone can sign up with an address they do not control. Needs an owned domain (~₱600–900/yr) verified in Resend.
- **Legal entity / licensed PSP / BIR-accredited receipts / AML-DPO program** — business track, runs in parallel.
- **Real credit-supplier integration** for live registry-retirement fulfillment (Carbonmark/Cloverly/Patch). Today a retirement produces a Carbonify certificate, not a Verra/Gold Standard registry receipt.

**Open engineering items that do not block the pilot but must be settled before live keys:**
- **Escrow — decided 2026-07-25 (Option B, method-gated hold)** ([DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md](DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md) #14, [ESCROW_DECISION.md](ESCROW_DECISION.md)). Implementation staged in `20260725000200_restore_escrow_hold_window.sql` (cards held ~7d; push payments immediate). **Apply during the pilot pre-flight** (it rewrites the settlement RPC), then wire `release_matured_escrow()` to a worker/cron and surface Held vs Available in the seller UI.
- ~~**The money-table RLS posture is not in version control**~~ ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-25** ([DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md](DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md) #13c) — captured in migration `20260725000100`, reconciled against a live `pg_policies` dump and applied to live. A fresh env now rebuilds the locked posture, and `supabase/diagnostics/money_table_rls_audit.sql` proves it (0 findings).
- **Migration `20260718001100`** (receipt FK schema-cache reload) — still pending on live. Non-fatal; clears a console 400/406 on receipts.
- **Testing gaps** ([TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md)) — no automated RPC/RLS integration tests, Playwright e2e not required in CI and not run on a seeded backend, no load test, accessibility pass partial.
- **Externally-blocked feature work** — MRV satellite/IoT feeds (#4), AI assistant backend (#7, needs an API key + running cost), farmer training content (#6e).

## 🔜 Do these next, in order

> **The engineering track is clear.** Both pre-live-keys code blockers are resolved:
> **#13c** (money-table RLS captured + applied + audited, 2026-07-25) and **#14** (escrow
> decided — Option B — and implemented, staged for the pilot). Everything below is
> pilot/ops/external. Committed + pushed as `e8efb4e` on `feature-user-onboarding-ux`.

1. **Run the pilot pre-flight** — [SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md](SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md) §1, all seven checks green (reconcile 0 · no errored `webhook_events` · 7 edge functions deployed · PayMongo in **test** mode with the webhook enabled · `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS` unset · Sentry receiving · frontend deployed). **Plus, in this same window:**
   - **Apply the staged escrow migration** [`20260725000200`](../supabase/migrations/20260725000200_restore_escrow_hold_window.sql), **redeploy + schedule** `process-payouts` (cron ~15 min, so `release_matured_escrow()` fires), and run the 4 escrow reconcile checks in [ESCROW_DECISION.md](ESCROW_DECISION.md) §6 (card→held, push→immediate, matured release, refund-while-held — each `reconcile_financials()` = 0). **Apply this BEFORE inviting pilot users**, so the beta exercises escrow on test money.
   - **Run** [`money_table_rls_audit.sql`](../supabase/diagnostics/money_table_rls_audit.sql) → expect **0 rows** (confirms #13c holds).
2. **Decide the beta database** — [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) §3. Recommendation: reuse the current live project now that reconcile is clean, but purge or clearly label leftover test projects/listings first.
3. **Confirm the `20260718000000`–`000700` batch is fully applied on live** — see the apply-status note below. One query settles it.
4. **Run the closed beta** — invite ~8–15 users covering every role, disclose the runbook §2 limitations, hand out [UAT_TEST_SCRIPT.md](UAT_TEST_SCRIPT.md), and check `reconcile_financials()` = 0 daily.
5. **Then start the real-money gate** — email confirmation on (needs an owned domain), independent penetration test, legal/PSP track. This is the only remaining P0 tier and it's all external.

### ⚠️ Apply-status note (2026-07-21) — `20260718000000`–`000700`

The 2026-07-11 entries below say this seven-migration batch was written but **NOT applied**. Later
entries in this same file contradict that: validation failed live with
`column "available_credits" of relation "project_credits" does not exist`, which is only possible if
**`000700` (the column drop) had already landed**. So the batch was at least partly applied, and the
historical "apply these 7 next" instruction is stale — do not follow it blindly.

Settle it with one read-only query before the pilot rather than re-running migrations:

```sql
-- expect: no 'available_credits' row (000600/000700 landed)
select column_name, is_nullable from information_schema.columns
 where table_schema='public' and table_name='project_credits';

-- expect: the 4-arg signature only (000000 landed)
select p.proname, pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid) as args
  from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid=p.pronamespace
 where n.nspname='public' and p.proname='retire_credits_atomic';
```

Status of the later migrations is not ambiguous: **`000800` verified applied on live 2026-07-20**;
**`000900` + `001000` applied 2026-07-11**; **`001100` still pending**.

> The remainder of this file preserves the detailed audit trail and older snapshots for traceability.
>
> ### ✅ 2026-07-11 (live testing) — END-TO-END FLOW NOW WORKS; drift fixed migration-by-migration
> A full live run (developer submits → verifier validates → buy → retire) surfaced a chain of
> **live-DB-vs-code drift** bugs, each fixed by a small migration. Apply status on the live DB:
> - ✅ **`000900`** issuance triggers → `credits_available` (validation + auto-listing work). *Applied.*
> - ✅ **`001000`** certificates schema catch-up (retirement/purchase certs generate). *Applied.*
> - ⬜ **`001100`** receipt FK cache reload (below). *Pending — or run `notify pgrst, 'reload schema';`.*
> - ✅ **`000800`** RLS write-lockdown (the security one). **VERIFIED APPLIED on live 2026-07-20** —
>   a read-only `pg_policies` check confirms all three blanket-write holes (project_credits,
>   credit_listings, credit_retirements) are gone and the `project_credits_owner_or_admin_delete`
>   marker policy exists. The #1 launch blocker is closed.
>
> Confirmed working live after `000900`+`001000`: validate → project auto-lists → purchase → retire →
> certificate. See per-fix notes below.
>
> ### ✅ 2026-07-20 — BOOKS VERIFIED BALANCED (`reconcile_financials()` = 0 on live)
> Ran the reconciliation against live. It flagged **4 `transaction_unaccounted` rows** — all ₱1.00,
> all between the owner's own test accounts (`louiecaparoso12` ↔ `johnlouiecaparoso12`), created
> **2026-06-26 to 2026-07-01**, i.e. pre-cutover client-side writes that never created a payment_intent
> or ledger group (exactly the legacy residue check #6 was built to surface — not a regression, and
> impossible to recreate now that the RLS lockdown is verified live). Footprint check showed **zero**
> dependent certificates / ledger entries / payment intents, so the four rows were **deleted**.
> `reconcile_financials()` now returns **0 rows** — a clean baseline for the test-key soft launch
> (see [SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md](SOFT_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md) §1a).
>
> ### 🛠️ 2026-07-11 — RECEIPT JOIN 400 (`credit_transactions ↔ profiles` not in PostgREST cache)
> The receipt embeds `buyer/seller:profiles!credit_transactions_*_id_fkey(...)` and 400'd with "Could not
> find a relationship … in the schema cache", then the per-profile fallback 406'd under `profiles` RLS — so
> the receipt rendered without counterparty names. The buyer/seller→`profiles(id)` FKs exist
> (`20260606000100`/`20260626000700`); **PostgREST's relationship cache was stale.** **Fix:** migration
> **`20260718001100_credit_tx_profile_fk_reload.sql`** re-asserts both FKs (idempotent, NOT VALID) and
> reloads the schema cache. Non-fatal (receipt already worked), but clears the console 400/406. Caveat:
> after the reload, `profiles` RLS still governs which embedded rows are visible, so a counterparty's name
> may still be blank by design — showing it would need a small `SECURITY DEFINER` name-only RPC (not a
> `profiles` RLS loosening, which we deliberately hardened).
>
> ### 🛠️ 2026-07-11 — CERTIFICATES SCHEMA CATCH-UP (retirement/purchase certs failed silently)
> After a retirement, certificate generation 400'd ("creating certificate with all fields" / retirement
> cert lookups by `retirement_id`). The `certificates` table predated version control and its live shape was
> **missing 11 columns** certificateService writes: `retirement_id` (the retirement↔certificate link the
> lookups filter on), `project_description`, `tonnes_co2`, `beneficiary_email`, `purpose`,
> `transaction_id_ref`, `payment_reference`, `wallet_address`, `purchase_date`, `purchase_datetime`,
> `timestamp`. The retirement itself is unaffected (burn+record are atomic); only the certificate row failed.
> **Fix:** migration **`20260718001000_certificates_schema_catchup.sql`** adds the columns (idempotent) and
> captures the full table into version control from the live dump. *(Applied — certs now generate.)*
>
> ### 🛠️ 2026-07-11 — DRIFT REPAIR: issuance triggers still wrote the dropped `available_credits`
> Validating a project failed live with `column "available_credits" of relation "project_credits" does not
> exist`. **Root cause:** the M6 consolidation dropped `available_credits` (migration `000700`) on the
> premise it was "maintained by NO trigger" — **that premise was wrong.** Two SECURITY DEFINER issuance
> triggers write it: `activate_validated_project_trigger` (fires on validation, latest body from
> `20260626000500`) and `mint_credits_on_ver_approval`. After the column drop, the validation trigger throws
> and the whole `projects` status UPDATE rolls back — a **DB** failure surfacing as a frontend error, which
> is why no redeploy fixed it.
> **Fix:** migration **`20260718000900_issuance_triggers_use_credits_available.sql`** redefines both trigger
> functions to write only the canonical `credits_available` (same pool/listing logic otherwise). Also fixed
> a real client bug: the verifier's price-save called `updateProject` without `isAdmin`, 406-ing on a
> non-owned project (PR #9).
> **Note on the real flow:** the LIVE DB issues on **validation** — `activate_validated_project_trigger`
> creates the pool **and** an active listing the moment a project is validated, so a validated project goes
> straight to the marketplace. (The `20260604010100` "decouple, mint-on-VER" model was superseded on live by
> `20260626000500`, which re-established validation-time issuance.) **⚠️ Apply `000900` in the SQL Editor;
> then validating a project should succeed and list it.**
>
> ### 🔴 2026-07-11 (earlier) — LIVE RLS AUDIT: 3 CREDIT-INTEGRITY HOLES FOUND + CLOSED
> Merged the 2026-07-11 batch to `main` via **PR #7**, then audited the live `pg_policies` for the money
> tables. **Good:** the four ledger tables (`credit_ownership`, `wallet_accounts`, `wallet_transactions`,
> `credit_transactions`) are already client-SELECT-only. **Bad — three live, exploitable write holes:**
> - `project_credits` had a `USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)` ALL policy → **any user could mint
>   `credits_available`**.
> - `credit_listings` had the same → **any user could rewrite any listing's `price_per_credit`**, which
>   checkout reads to compute the charge (buy real credits for ₱0.01 — defeats server-authoritative pricing).
> - `credit_retirements` had a client INSERT policy → **forge a retirement + certificate with no burn**.
>
> Closed by new migration **`20260718000800_lock_credit_pool_and_listing_writes.sql`** (writes now go only
> through the SECURITY DEFINER issuance trigger + service_role RPCs, which are RLS-exempt; sellers keep own
> listings; staff keep all). **✅ VERIFIED APPLIED on live 2026-07-20** (read-only `pg_policies` check:

> ### 🔎 2026-07-11 (later) — SENIOR REVIEW + 3 FOLLOW-UP CHANGES ON TOP OF THE 17 FIXES
> A senior-dev pass over architecture + security, on top of the audit below. **3 concrete changes made
> (working tree, uncommitted, still part of the same un-applied batch):**
> - **H1 regression corrected — do this BEFORE applying the batch.** Migration
>   `20260718000000_retire_credits_atomic_with_record.sql` had reintroduced
>   `v_user := coalesce(auth.uid(), p_user_id)` — the client-supplied-identity fallback that
>   `20260703000400` had deliberately removed. Now bound to `auth.uid()` with a null-reject (the 4-arg
>   signature/grant are unchanged, so the client caller is unaffected). Not exploitable under the
>   authenticated-only grant, but it silently undid a prior hardening; corrected while still un-applied.
> - **Dead client-side money writers deleted** — `addCreditsToPortfolio` / `removeCreditsFromPortfolio`
>   (290 lines) removed from `creditOwnershipService.js`. They did **un-transacted** browser writes to
>   `credit_ownership` + `credit_retirements` with a **client-supplied userId** (the TOCTOU/double-retire
>   pattern the atomic RPC replaced) and were called by no view. The read methods (`getUserCreditPortfolio`
>   / `getUserCreditStats`, used by `CreditPortfolioView` + `esgReportService`) are untouched.
> - **2 zero-byte dead files deleted** — `services/adminService.js`, `services/verifierService.js`
>   (imported nowhere). Progress against backlog #8.
>
> **Two review findings recorded, not yet actioned** (see [DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md](DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md)):
> - **🔴 The financial-table RLS posture is not in version control.** There is no `create policy` for
>   `credit_ownership` / `wallet_accounts` / `wallet_transactions` / `credit_transactions` anywhere in
>   `supabase/migrations/`; the only lockdown lives in the gated `supabase/cutover/` script (backlog P1).
>   Any fresh env (staging/DR/local) rebuilds with client-writable money tables. **The repo cannot prove
>   the money tables are locked down** — capture the live `pg_policies` into a versioned migration.
> - **🟠 Escrow was silently reverted.** `escrow_holds` has had no writer since `20260606000600`; every
>   later `process_marketplace_purchase` credits `seller_payable` directly. Sellers are immediately
>   withdrawable with **no dispute/chargeback hold window** — a real fraud exposure on the card rail once
>   live keys are on. Decide instant-payout-by-design vs. restore the hold.
>
> Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **313 tests ✅** after all three changes.

> ### 🛠️ 2026-07-11 — WHOLE-CODEBASE CODE AUDIT + 17 FIXES → [CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-11.md](CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-11.md)
> A four-reviewer code-level bug hunt (money path · expansion features · registry/investor · auth/roles),
> every finding adjudicated against the actual RPC/RLS SQL. **Fixed 17** (5 HIGH, 6 MED, 6 LOW) and
> consolidated the `project_credits` column drift. Highlights:
> - **H1 retirement is now atomic** — the burn + `credit_retirements` insert happen in one RPC
>   transaction (the HIGH previously "left unfixed on purpose" is closed).
> - **H2 wallet top-up double-credit** and **M1 double payout** — idempotency/claim guards added.
> - **H3 (NEW)** — any signed-in user could read/enumerate **every** project's compliance PII; the
>   bucket read policy is now scoped. **H4** send-approval-email relay closed. **H5 (NEW)** offtake
>   project-reassignment closed.
> - **`project_credits` drift RESOLVED** — `credits_available` (numeric) is canonical; the stale
>   `available_credits` stray is retired via expand/contract migrations.
>
> **7 new migrations (`20260718000000`–`000700`) + 4 edge-fn redeploys are written but NOT yet applied
> to the live DB.** Deploy order + pairing rules are in §"2026-07-11 deploy runbook" below. Three LOWs
> and one H3 residual (public/private bucket split) were deliberately deferred.
>

>
> #### Earlier baseline — 2026-07-09
>
> **All 31 migrations applied. Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · 312 tests ✅.**
>
> The seven expansion features, scored **bullet-by-bullet against the code** (not against these notes)
> in **[EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md](EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md)**:

> | # | Feature | First audit | Now |
> |---|---|---|---|

> ### 🔎 Codebase audits
> - **[CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-11.md](CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-11.md)** (latest) — whole-codebase, 17 fixed. The
>   retirement-atomicity HIGH and the `send-approval-email` relay noted below are now **fixed** (pending
>   live apply/redeploy). Two NEW HIGHs were found and fixed: unscoped project-document reads (PII) and
>   offtake project-reassignment.
> - **[CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-09.md](CODE_AUDIT_2026-07-09.md)** — earlier pass (empty /analytics charts ·
>   the 15s marketplace refresh wiping the grid · a load race · one unpriced listing reporting ₱0).
>
> ### 🔴 Do these next, in order *(SUPERSEDED 2026-07-21 — kept for history)*
>
> **⚠️ This list is stale. The current next steps are in "🔜 Do these next, in order" at the top of this
> file.** Items 1 and 2 below are contradicted or overtaken by later entries: the migration batch was at
> least partly applied (see the apply-status note at the top), `000800` was verified applied on live
> 2026-07-20, and the runtime verification in item 3 was exercised end-to-end on 2026-07-11.
>
> 1. **Apply the 2026-07-11 fixes to the live DB** — 7 new migrations + 4 edge-fn redeploys, written but
>    not yet applied. Order + pairing rules in the "2026-07-11 deploy runbook" note below. The
>    `20260718000000` H1 migration already carries the `auth.uid()` correction (above) — no extra step,
>    just apply the current file. *(Stale — confirm with the query at the top instead.)*
> 2. **Capture the live financial-table RLS into a versioned migration** (backlog P1). Dump
>    `select * from pg_policies where tablename in ('credit_ownership','wallet_accounts','wallet_transactions','credit_transactions')`
>    and codify it, so the migration chain — not an out-of-band cutover script — *is* the security posture.
> 3. **[RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md](RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md)** — nothing here has been
>    exercised against the live DB. Unit tests prove the pure math; they prove nothing about RLS
>    policies or RPC grants. **Start with §1, the privilege-escalation check.**
> 4. **Independent penetration test** — last P0 before live payment keys.
> 5. **Email confirmation** — OFF by choice (needs a domain, ~₱600–900/yr; Resend's free tier is
>    3,000 emails/mo). Until then **anyone can sign up with an address they do not control.**
>
> ### Two honest caveats about the positioning
> - **"National biomass registry"** — the public [`/registry`](../src/views/RegistryView.vue) is a
>   *certificate table*. It never shows methodology, development status, feedstock, or capacity;
>   that data lives only on each project's own page. And there is no DENR/CCC linkage.
> - **"ESG reporting platform"** — the ESG export is **credit-owner side only**. Developers,
>   farmers, and verifiers have no ESG export.

>
> **① Run these 7 migrations in the SQL Editor** (`supabase/migrations/`):
> `20260718000000_retire_credits_atomic_with_record` (H1) · `…000100_scope_project_documents_read`
> (H3) · `…000200_offtake_update_ownership_guard` (H5) · `…000300_payout_processing_returns_claim`
> (M1) · `…000400_kyc_level_clamp` (M3) · `…000500_biomass_rpc_grant_hygiene` (L7) ·
> `…000600_available_credits_nullable` (M6 phase 1).
>
> **② Redeploy 4 edge functions:** `paymongo-webhook` (H2) · `paymongo-checkout` (L2) ·
> `send-approval-email` (H4) · `process-payouts` (M1). *(`npm run deploy:webhook` /
> `deploy:paymongo` cover the first two; the other two: `supabase functions deploy <name>`.)*
>
> **③ Deploy the frontend** (normal build) — carries H1-client, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, L5, L6, L8, L9.
>
> **④ Then run the final migration:** `…000700_drop_available_credits` (M6 phase 2) — **only after ③**.
>
> **Hard pairing rules:** H1 migration must land **with** the frontend (old 3-arg
> `retire_credits_atomic` is dropped); M1 migration must land **with** the `process-payouts` redeploy
> (RPC return type changed `void→boolean`). The `available_credits` drop is expand/contract: `…000600`
> before the frontend, `…000700` after — no broken window.
>
> **Deferred (not touched):** L1 displayed-vs-charged price · L3 client-computed receipt total · L4
> `getTransactions` writing on a read path · H3 residual (a doc a validated project publishes is still
> viewable; the full fix is a public/private bucket split). **Then verify live** per
> [RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md](RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md).
>
> 🧪 **2026-07-09 — ALL 31 MIGRATIONS APPLIED. THE GAP IS NOW RUNTIME, NOT CODE.**
> All seven expansion features are code-complete to the limit of what code can do (#1 8/8 · #2 6/6 ·
> #3 7/7 · #4 6/8 · #5 7/7 · #6 5/6 · #7 interface-only). Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **312 tests ✅**.

> step-by-step click-through with the expected result at each step and, when it fails, which layer
> broke. It starts with the **privilege-escalation check**, because nothing else matters if that hole
> is open.
>
> 📈 **2026-07-09 — PLANTATION PERFORMANCE MONITORING (#6f). No migration.** The parcel register was
> static: it stored `expected_yield_tonnes` and never compared it to anything. Deliveries now carry
> `parcel_id` (migration #31), so each parcel card shows **actual vs expected**, colour-coded.
> Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **312 tests ✅** (+9).
>
> **The subtlety that shapes it:** `expected_yield_tonnes` is an **annual** figure, so actuals are
> summed over the **trailing 12 months**, not lifetime. A three-year-old parcel compared against one
> year's expectation would report **300% performance** and mean nothing. Lifetime tonnage is shown
> separately, as context rather than as the ratio.
>
> A parcel with no expected yield reports `performance: null` — **not zero, and not 100%**. An absent
> target is not a met one. Over-performance is reported honestly (130%), never capped at 100%.
> Non-mass units (sacks/bales/m³) are excluded, as everywhere else in the farmer math.
>
> 🌾 **2026-07-09 — FARMER CARBON PARTICIPATION (#6 now 5/6).** A farmer could see sacks and pesos,
> never how their feedstock became carbon. Migration **#31** adds `farmer_deliveries.project_id` — the
> missing link that made attribution impossible — plus `farmer_carbon_participation()`, and the Farmer
> Portal gains a **Carbon** tab. Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **303 tests ✅** (+15).
>
> **The attribution rule is written down before the code** in
> [FARMER_CARBON_ATTRIBUTION.md](FARMER_CARBON_ATTRIBUTION.md): *pro-rata by delivered mass, per
> project, lifetime-to-date* — `verified_tCO₂e × farmer_tonnes / project_tonnes`, over **confirmed**
> deliveries and **approved** VERs. Shares sum to exactly 1, so a farmer can never be attributed carbon
> the project never verified. What a smallholder is told they contributed is a claim they will repeat;
> the doc records why this rule and not per-delivery carbon factors (which would let farmer totals
> exceed the project's verified total — the double-counting failure this platform exists to prevent).
>
> **Presented as an ESTIMATE, never as credit ownership** — the farmer cannot sell or retire it, and
> the UI says so first, not in a footnote. Deliveries in **sacks/bales/m³ are excluded from both sides
> of the ratio** (no bulk density → treating a sack as a tonne would corrupt *every other farmer's*
> share, since the denominator is shared), and the farmer is told how many were excluded and why.
> Deliveries the buyer never attributed to a project are counted and surfaced too.
>
> Buyers now name the project when confirming receipt. `confirm_farmer_delivery()` validates the buyer
> **owns** that project — otherwise a buyer could attribute feedstock to a rival's project, or inflate
> one farmer's share of it. The 3-arg version is dropped first: a defaulted 4th parameter would create
> an ambiguous overload for existing callers.
>
> **Migrations #30 + #31 APPLIED (2026-07-09).** All 31 migrations are live.
>
> 🗂️ **2026-07-09 — INVESTOR DATA ROOM SHIPPED (#5 COMPLETE, 7/7).** The portal showed a document
> *count badge* linking out to the project page. A data room is not a link: it is documents you open
> in context, plus a record of who opened them. Investors now open documents inside
> [`/investor`](../src/views/InvestorPortalView.vue) via short-lived signed URLs; developers see
> **who is reading what** at [`/developer/data-room`](../src/views/DataRoomActivityView.vue).
> Migration **#30**. Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **288 tests ✅** (+16).
>
> **Three deliberate calls.** (1) The access log is written **only** through
> `log_data_room_access()`, a SECURITY DEFINER RPC that derives *both* the viewer (`auth.uid()`) and
> the developer (`projects.user_id`) server-side — with a plain INSERT policy the client supplies
> `developer_id` and could forge either side, or erase a row that incriminates them. (2) **Viewers are
> counted, never named.** An investor doing diligence reasonably expects not to be published as a
> named lead list; "is anyone reading my PDD?" is answered by distinct-viewer counts. (3) **Distinct
> viewers, not raw views** — one investor refreshing a PDD ten times is one interested party, and
> "10 viewers" would flatter the developer with a meaningless number. Self-views aren't recorded.
>
> **Migration #30 APPLIED (2026-07-09).**
>
> 🔓 **2026-07-09 — EMAIL CONFIRMATION IS OFF, DELIBERATELY (accepted risk, not an oversight).**
> Supabase Auth "Confirm email" stays **disabled** because the custom-SMTP sender needs a paid domain
> the owner isn't buying yet. Consequence: **anyone can sign up with an email address they do not
> control.** That is tolerable for demos and testing; it is **not** tolerable once real users hold
> real money, because account recovery and every notification route through an unverified address.
> **Before real users:** register a domain → verify it in Resend → set the Supabase SMTP sender +
> creds → re-enable confirmation. Steps in [TODAY_2026-07-07.md](TODAY_2026-07-07.md) §1c. No code
> change needed; signup is a standard `supabase.auth.signUp()`.
>
> 📑 **2026-07-09 — #1 COMPLETE (8/8) · #4 now 6/8.** Two small closers, **no migration**:
> **MRV Report** is now an optional project document type (a published monitoring report reaches the
> public project page — #1's last bullet), and the MRV dashboard gained a dedicated **Energy
> generated** tile (kWh → MWh → GWh). The tile sums `energy_kwh` only and **deliberately excludes
> `energy_saved_kwh`** — energy *saved* is avoided consumption, a different claim, and adding them
> would overstate what the project produced. Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **272 tests ✅**.
>
> **Scorecard:** #1 **8/8** · #2 **6/6** · #3 **7/7** · #4 **6/8** (only satellite + IoT, both

> Full detail: [EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md](EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md).
>
> 🌱 **2026-07-09 — CO₂ REMOVED vs AVOIDED SPLIT (closes #4b + #4c).** The MRV dashboard summed every
> verified reduction into one tCO₂e figure. Registries and buyers price removals and avoidances very
> differently — a durable removal (biochar, afforestation) is not interchangeable with an avoided
> emission (methane capture, clean energy displacing coal) — so collapsing them hid the distinction a
> carbon buyer looks for first. Migration **#29** adds `reduction_type` to
> `verified_emission_reductions`; the **verifier now asserts it at approval** (pre-selected from the
> project category, never auto-applied); the dashboard shows **removed / avoided / unclassified**.
> Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **269 tests ✅** (+11).
>
> **Nothing is backfilled, and that is the point.** Legacy VERs were approved without anyone being
> asked. Guessing from the project category would stamp an assertion onto an already-issued credit
> that no verifier made — a registry-grade error. They stay NULL and surface in an explicit
> **Unclassified** bucket. The category only *pre-selects* the verifier's dropdown
> ([`suggestedReductionType`](../src/constants/mrv.js)) because a category isn't decisive either: a
> biochar project removes carbon *and* the bio-briquettes burnt alongside it avoid emissions.
>
> Drift-safety matters more than usual here: **issuance must never fail because a classification
> column is missing**, so `approveReport` retries the VER insert without `reduction_type` and mints
> the credits unclassified. The dashboard read falls back the same way.
>
> **Migration #29 APPLIED (2026-07-09).** **⬜ To finish:** approve an MRV report → pick
> Removal/Avoidance → the dashboard splits it.
>
> 🏷️ **2026-07-09 — REGISTRY CREDIBILITY PASS (closes #1c + #1g).** **Methodology is now an enum**
> ([`projectRegistry.js`](../src/constants/projectRegistry.js)): Verra (VCS), Gold Standard,
> Puro.earth, ISO 14064, CDM, ACR, CAR, Plan Vivo, ISCC, a PH national methodology, and the interim
> Carbonify Standard — plus **Other**, so no developer is forced into a wrong standard. It was a
> free-text box, so "Gold Standard", "gold standard" and "GS" were three different projects to any
> filter. **`development_status` is a new column** (migration **#28**): concept → feasibility →
> financing → construction → operational → decommissioned. It is **orthogonal to `projects.status`**,
> which is the Carbonify *validation* workflow — a project can be fully `validated` on the platform
> and still be nothing but a feasibility study in the real world, and conflating the two was the bug.
> The Investor Portal now **filters by standard and by stage**. Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ ·
> **258 tests ✅** (+11).
>
> Care taken: `methodology` stays **TEXT with no CHECK** — legacy rows hold free text like
> "Verra VM0044", and a constraint would reject them on any later UPDATE, including ones unrelated to
> methodology. Editing an old project maps its free text into **Other** with the text preserved rather
> than silently discarding it. `development_status` is **nullable** — defaulting existing projects to
> 'concept' would assert something untrue about every project already in the registry. And the
> Investor Portal's query **falls back** if the column is absent, rather than 400-ing the whole
> pipeline over one optional field.
>
> **Migration #28 APPLIED (2026-07-09).**
>
> 🤝 **2026-07-09 — OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS / ERPAs SHIPPED (closes #5's biggest gap).** Until now every
> IRR in the Investor Portal rested on an **assumed** credit price for every credit the project might
> ever issue. An ERPA is what turns a slice of that into **contracted** revenue. New
> [`/developer/offtakes`](../src/views/OfftakeAgreementsView.vue) lets a developer record agreements
> (counterparty, volume, price, term, status); the Investor Portal now splits **contracted vs
> speculative** revenue, blends the negotiated price with the listed price for the remainder, and
> shows a **downside IRR on contracted revenue alone**. Migration **#27**. 22 new tests.
> Build ✅ · ESLint 0 ✅ · **247 tests ✅**.
>
> **Confidentiality is the load-bearing design call.** Counterparty names and negotiated prices are
> commercially sensitive, so full rows are **owner-only** under RLS. Investors reach only aggregates
> via `offtake_summary()` — a SECURITY DEFINER RPC that returns contracted volume/value/count per
> project and **never** a counterparty, price, or document. Insert is doubly guarded (you must claim
> yourself as developer **and** own the project), or a developer could attach an agreement to someone
> else's project and inflate its contracted revenue.
>
> **Only `signed`/`active` count as contracted.** A draft, a negotiation, a completed or a terminated
> agreement contributes nothing — counting any of them would restate speculative revenue as
> contracted, the precise error this feature exists to prevent.
>
> Two correctness details found while building: **`irrContracted` is null for two different reasons**
> — nothing contracted, *or* contracted revenue ≤ OPEX (every year negative, so no real IRR exists).
> The second is a **solvency warning**, not a missing number, so `contractedCoversOpex` disambiguates
> and the portal renders them differently. And **over-commitment** (contracted volume > estimated
> issuance) is flagged in both the developer view and the portal rather than letting speculative
> volume go negative.
>
> **Migration #27 APPLIED (2026-07-09).** **⬜ To finish:** a developer records a signed agreement →
> the Investor Portal shows contracted % and the downside IRR.

> ✅ **2026-07-09 — TOP 3 AUDIT GAPS CLOSED.** **#2 buyer history** (a Buyer history section on
> [`/developer/ledger`](../src/views/CarbonAssetLedgerView.vue): counterparties per project with
> credits, value, purchase count, last purchase — the ERPA use case), **#4 farmers participating +

>
> **Migration #26 (`20260712000000_parcel_supply_visibility.sql`) APPLIED (2026-07-09)** — plantation
> hectares now resolve. The audit wrongly called hectares "no migration": migration #25 made
> `farm_parcels` readable only by the owning farmer, so a developer couldn't see the area of parcels
> supplying them. #26 adds a narrow policy — a buyer may read a parcel **only** if it supplied them a
> delivery **they confirmed**. The "—" fallback remains as a drift-safe degrade path.
>
> Two correctness notes worth keeping: **biomass tonnage excludes sacks/bales/m³** (their mass depends
> on bulk density — summing them would invent a number) and counts **confirmed deliveries only**;
> **buyer names degrade to "Unknown buyer"** if `profiles` reads are RLS-blocked, rather than erroring.
>
> 🔍 **2026-07-09 — BULLET-BY-BULLET AUDIT OF THE 7 EXPANSION FEATURES → [EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md](EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md).**
> The features were tracked at *feature* granularity ("#5 Investor Portal — shipped"), which hid
> missing **sub-items inside shipped features**. Audited against the code, the feature-level status
> below was **over-optimistic**. Real per-bullet score: **#1 5/8 · #2 5/6 · #3 6/7 · #4 0/8 fully ·
> #5 5/7 · #6 3/6 · #7 0/5.** The plumbing for all seven exists; the **investor- and farmer-facing
> storytelling layers** are the consistent gap. Concretely missing, despite the feature being marked
> shipped:
> - **#2 buyer history** — the developer ledger never selects `buyer_id`; only aggregate sold totals.
>   This is the exact ERPA / institutional-buyer use case the feature was built for.
> - **#4 farmers participating + plantation hectares** — the MRV dashboard **never reads**
>   `farm_parcels`/`farmer_deliveries`, even though migration #25 created them. Also no
>   avoided-vs-removed CO₂ split, and no "biomass collected" metric. The stated "biggest
>   differentiator" is the least complete feature.
> - **#5 offtake agreements** — zero functional code repo-wide. Every IRR in the Investor Portal
>   therefore rests on an *assumed* credit price, not contracted revenue.
> - **#6 carbon participation + training** — a farmer sees sacks and pesos, never how their feedstock
>   became a carbon credit. Plantation "monitoring" is a static register with no actual-vs-expected.
> - **#1 methodology is free text**, not an enum — Verra/Gold Standard/Puro/ISO are only placeholder

> **Two deliberate design calls, both worth knowing:**
> 1. **Farmer payments are record-keeping, not settlement.** `payment_status` is a bookkeeping flag;
>    it never touches `ledger_entries`/`escrow_holds`/`payout_requests`. The proven money path
>    (`reconcile_financials()` = 0) is untouched by this feature.
> 2. **Farmers bypass the KYB gate on `/biomass/sell`.** KYB gates *payouts* (real money leaving the
>    platform); no platform money moves for feedstock, and farmers are admin-approved via the role
>    application. Requiring a business registration from a smallholder was friction with no safety

## TL;DR

Phases 0–8 are **code-complete** and the **money path is fully proven** (purchase + subscription
+ **payout + refund**, all reconciling to 0 — verified 2026-07-01).
The 2026-06-26 session shipped DPA tooling, the edit/resubmit loop, project-detail page,
`local|supplier` + SDG filters, ESG export, finance console, VAT invoices, public registry,
a schema-drift catch-up, then a **codeable-backlog sweep** (scored rubric, boundary map, MRV
reminders, offline SW, mobile polish) and a **Phase 2–4 sweep** (payment-path tests → 114
tests, composite indexes + paginated history, `/market` dashboard + double-claim guard, buyer
portfolio P&L) and nav links. The **2026-07-01 session** then proved the money-path edges
(payout + refund), shipped the codeable backlog + admin action consoles, and runtime-verified
everything. Build green, ESLint 0, **145 tests** (~86 commits ahead of `main`).

> ✅ **2026-06-26 — THE CORE MONEY PATH IS PROVEN.** The §0 migrations were applied, the 3
> PayMongo secrets were set, the **bug-fixed `paymongo-webhook` was deployed**, and a real
> sandbox purchase (PayMongo test card on the Vercel preview) **settled cleanly** —
> `reconcile_financials()` returns **0 rows** after the sale, and **subscription** was verified
> too (`/upgrade` → Pro flipped `profiles.plan`). The #1 blocker the rest of this doc was built
> around is **cleared**. The registry, `/market` dashboard, and offline service worker were also
> verified live in the same session.

> ✅ **2026-07-01 — MONEY PATH FULLY PROVEN + click-through complete.** The remaining edges were
> verified: **KYB-gated payout** and **cart + refund** both settled with `reconcile_financials()`
> at **0 rows**. The `account-deletion` edge function was deployed (DPA erasure works). The
> session's new features (seller per-project earnings, purchases pagination, structured
> additionality/permanence, saved-search/price alerts) were all runtime-verified, and the admin
> KYB-review + refunds consoles + seller KYB form + KYC-level admin override were exercised.

**What's left of the money path:** ✅ **nothing** — as of 2026-07-03 the gated cutover is
**done**: the Buy/top-up/retire UI runs fully server-side and the financial-table RLS lockdown
has been applied and re-verified (all six flows reconcile to 0). Everything else depends on an
external partner (real registry, AML data, PSP) or ops/legal.

> ✅ **Migrations applied + audit clean** (2026-06-26). The live DB had drifted behind the
> migrations all session; the §0 catch-up (`20260626000700`) + audit
> ([diagnostics/schema_catchup_audit.sql](../supabase/diagnostics/schema_catchup_audit.sql))
> resolved it. Re-run the audit anytime to confirm (empty result = good).

## 0. Pending migrations — apply via SQL Editor (idempotent, safe to re-run)

This session added migrations. Apply any not yet run, in this order (all use
`IF NOT EXISTS` / `NOT VALID` / `on conflict do nothing`, so re-running is harmless):

| # | Migration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `20260626000700_schema_catchup.sql` | Ensures all drift-prone columns + the `credit_transactions→profiles` FKs + widened `projects` status constraint (supersedes the column-adds of 000100/000400). |
| 2 | `20260607000200_supplier_orders.sql` | `supplier_orders` table (audit flagged it missing). |
| 3 | `20260626000200_notify_project_submitted_trigger.sql` | Verifier bell on submit/resubmit. |
| 4 | `20260626000300_backfill_validated_listings.sql` | Publishes validated projects to the marketplace + backfills. |
| 5 | `20260626000500_fix_credit_pool_availability.sql` | Fixes the `credits_available` pool (false "sold out"). |
| 6 | `20260626000600_admin_finance_console.sql` | Admin finance RPCs (`is_admin`-gated). |
| 7 | `20260626000800_seed_tax_settings.sql` | Seeds VAT/company tax settings. |
| 8 | `20260626000900_public_registry.sql` | Public registry RPCs (anon-granted). |
| 9 | `20260626001000_performance_indexes.sql` | Hot-path indexes. |

Already applied earlier this session: `20260626000000` (DPA), `20260626000100` (status
constraint), `20260626000400` (marketplace reconcile). After applying, **re-run the audit**
to confirm an empty result.

> 🆕 **Two more migrations from the Phase 2–4 code sweep** (apply via SQL Editor; idempotent,
> drift-safe, no behaviour change to existing flows):
> | # | Migration | Purpose |
> |---|---|---|
> | 10 | `20260627000000_scale_composite_indexes.sql` | Composite hot-path indexes (sold-qty scan, history, seller listings). |
> | 11 | `20260627000100_market_integrity.sql` | Double-claim serial guard + `public_market_stats()` RPC (powers `/market`). |
> | 12 | `20260627000200_fix_admin_recent_transactions_casts.sql` | **Fixes a live 42804** — `admin_recent_transactions()` selected raw `credit_transactions` columns with no casts, so on a drifted DB (e.g. `quantity` integer ≠ declared numeric) the Finance Console RPC 400'd. Now casts each column to its declared type. |

> 🆕 **2026-07-03 migrations.** The cutover fixes (13–16) were **applied + verified live** this
> session. The security fixes (17–18) are **NEW and NOT yet applied** — apply them and re-test
> before real users (see [dev/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md](dev/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md)).
> | # | Migration | Status | Purpose |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 13 | `20260703000000_update_wallet_balance_atomic.sql` | ✅ applied | Wallet top-up settlement fn (was defined in no migration). |
> | 14 | `20260703000100_wallet_transactions_external_reference.sql` | ✅ applied | Adds the missing top-up audit column + index. |
> | 15 | `20260703000200_fix_credit_ownership_quantity_constraint.sql` | ✅ applied | Drops stray `> 0` constraint (blocked retirement); asserts `>= 0`. |
> | 16 | `20260702000000_fix_marketplace_ownership_status.sql` | ✅ applied | `credit_ownership.status = 'owned'` (was `'active'`, rejected by constraint). |
> | 17 | `20260703000300_harden_profiles_role_kyc.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-04)** | 🔴 Blocks direct client writes to `profiles.role`/`kyc_level` (privilege escalation). Admin RPCs still work. **Verify a normal user can't self-promote.** |
> | 18 | `20260703000400_retire_credits_authuid.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-04)** | Binds retirement identity to `auth.uid()`. **Retest flow E → reconcile 0.** |

> 🆕 **2026-07-07 migration** (apply via SQL Editor; idempotent). See
> [TODAY_2026-07-07.md](TODAY_2026-07-07.md).
> | # | Migration | Status | Purpose |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 19 | `20260707000000_project_documents_bucket.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | 🔴 Creates the `project-documents` storage bucket + RLS so developer compliance PDFs actually upload and are retrievable (were never stored before — dead links). Also backs farmer delivery-proof uploads (#25). |
> | 20 | `20260707000100_project_documents_private.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Makes that bucket **private** (compliance PDFs = sensitive PII) + authenticated SELECT for signed URLs. App resolves short-lived signed URLs; anon can no longer open raw docs. |

> 🆕 **2026-07-08 migration** (apply via SQL Editor; idempotent, additive, drift-safe).
> | # | Migration | Status | Purpose |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 21 | `20260707000200_project_registry_fields.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-08)** | Adds `feedstock`, `capacity`, `capacity_unit` to `projects` (+ non-negative `capacity` check) for the investor-facing Project Registry. Applied live; the form now persists these + `methodology`. ⬜ Remaining: a runtime click-through (submit a project with the new fields → confirm they render on the detail page). |
> | 22 | `20260708000000_biomass_marketplace.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-08)** | Expansion #3. Creates `biomass_products` (supplier feedstock catalog) + `biomass_rfqs` (buyer request + folded quote) with RLS (public browse of active products; owner writes; buyer-or-seller-or-admin reads RFQs) and 3 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for status transitions (`submit_biomass_quote` / `respond_biomass_quote` / `close_biomass_rfq`). Applied live. ⬜ Remaining: runtime click-through (list feedstock KYB-gated → request a quote as another user → quote → accept). |
> | 24 | `20260710000000_project_financials.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Expansion #5. Adds `capex`, `opex`, `project_lifetime_years`, `funding_target`, `funding_raised` to `projects` (non-negative checks) so the Investor Portal can model IRR/NPV/payback + funding gap. The submit form now captures them (new "Financials" subsection). ⬜ Remaining: a developer edits a project → fills Financials → the Investor Portal shows IRR/NPV. |
> | 31 | `20260717000000_farmer_carbon_participation.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Expansion #6's carbon bullet. Adds `farmer_deliveries.project_id` (the link whose absence made attribution impossible), re-creates `confirm_farmer_delivery()` with a 4th `p_project_id` param **validating the buyer owns that project**, and adds `farmer_carbon_participation()` (SECURITY DEFINER, so a farmer never needs read access to `verified_emission_reductions` or to other farmers' deliveries). Rule: `verified × farmer_tonnes / project_tonnes` over confirmed deliveries + approved VERs — see [FARMER_CARBON_ATTRIBUTION.md](FARMER_CARBON_ATTRIBUTION.md). **Apply, then a buyer confirms a delivery naming a project → the farmer's Carbon tab shows their attributed tCO₂e.** |
> | 30 | `20260716000000_data_room_access_log.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Expansion #5's last bullet. Creates `data_room_access_log` (project, developer, viewer, document, action) with **no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy** — writes go only through `log_data_room_access()`, a SECURITY DEFINER RPC deriving viewer from `auth.uid()` and developer from `projects.user_id`, so neither identity can be forged and a log row can't be erased by the person it incriminates. Reads are limited to the two parties + admin (one investor must not see which rivals are doing diligence). Self-views and non-validated projects are skipped. **Apply, then an investor opens a document in `/investor` → the developer sees it at `/developer/data-room`.** |
> | 29 | `20260715000000_ver_reduction_type.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Adds `verified_emission_reductions.reduction_type` (`removal` / `avoidance`, **nullable**, CHECK-constrained + partial index on approved rows). Closes #4's CO₂-avoided-vs-removed bullet. **Deliberately not backfilled** — a legacy VER was approved without anyone asserting a type, and guessing from the project category would fake a verifier's assertion on an issued credit. The MRV dashboard shows an explicit **Unclassified** bucket instead. **Apply, then approve an MRV report → pick Removal/Avoidance → the dashboard splits it.** |
> | 28 | `20260714000000_project_development_status.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Adds `projects.development_status` (concept / feasibility / financing / construction / operational / decommissioned, nullable, CHECK-constrained + partial index) — the **real-world lifecycle**, distinct from `projects.status` (the Carbonify validation workflow). Closes #1's "development status" bullet. `methodology` intentionally stays free TEXT (the UI drives it from a canonical list; a CHECK would reject legacy rows like "Verra VM0044" on any later UPDATE). **Apply, then Submit/Edit Project offers a Development Status dropdown and the Investor Portal gains a stage filter.** |
> | 27 | `20260713000000_offtake_agreements.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Expansion #5's missing bullet. Creates `offtake_agreements` (project, counterparty, volume, price, term, status) — **owner-only RLS**, since counterparty + price are commercially sensitive — plus `offtake_summary(uuid[])`, a SECURITY DEFINER RPC returning only contracted volume/value/count per validated project (never a counterparty or price) so investors can see contracted share without seeing terms. Insert is doubly guarded: `developer_id = auth.uid()` **and** the caller owns the project. **Apply, then a developer records a signed agreement → the Investor Portal shows contracted % + downside IRR.** |
> | 26 | `20260712000000_parcel_supply_visibility.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Unblocks **plantation hectares** on the MRV dashboard. #25 made `farm_parcels` owner-private, so a developer couldn't read the area of parcels supplying them. Adds a narrow SELECT policy: a buyer may read a parcel **only** where it supplied them a delivery with `status='confirmed'` (a pending/rejected delivery grants nothing, so a farmer can't be exposed by merely logging one). Owner INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE from #25 untouched. Plus a `(parcel_id, buyer_id, status)` index. **Apply, then the MRV dashboard's “Plantation hectares” stops showing “—”.** |
> | 25 | `20260711000000_farmer_portal.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-09)** | Expansion #6. Adds `farm_parcels` (plantation register, owner-private RLS) + `farmer_deliveries` (delivery against an accepted RFQ, with proof docs, buyer confirmation, and a bookkeeping `payment_status`) + 3 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`record_farmer_delivery` / `confirm_farmer_delivery` / `mark_farmer_delivery_paid` — no INSERT/UPDATE policy, so a farmer can't mark their own delivery paid). Also **widens the two role gates**: `assign_user_role()` now admits `'farmer'`, `role_applications.role_requested` CHECK now admits `'farmer'`, and `notify_role_application_trigger()` routes farmer applications to admins. **Apply, then run the click-through in the header note.** |
> | 23 | `20260709000000_admin_set_kyb_verified.sql` | ✅ **applied (2026-07-08)** | Adds `admin_set_kyb_verified(uuid, boolean)` (is_admin-gated) so an admin can manually verify a business from **User Management** — clears the "Business verification required" gate for a developer who never filed a KYB application (previously only `review_kyb_application` could set `kyb_verified`, and only against an existing application). Also revokes client `update(kyb_verified)` so users can't self-verify. **Apply, then: Admin → User Management → edit a user → tick "Business verified (KYB)" → Save → that account's Sell-Feedstock gate disappears.** |

### 0.4 🆕 2026-07-22 — role audit + hardening migrations (NOT yet applied)

Apply in order. All additive and idempotent, each with its own `AFTER APPLYING,
TEST` checklist and a rollback block in its header.

| # | Migration | Purpose | Inert until applied? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `20260721000400_seller_listing_management.sql` | `update_my_listing` RPC — sellers set price / quantity / pause. Clamps quantity to the pool so a raised listing cannot fail *after* the buyer pays. | Manage-listing errors |
| 2 | `20260722000100_verifier_independence_guard.sql` | Nobody may validate a project they own, or approve VERs against it. | ⚠️ **Silently** — UI works, guard absent |
| 3 | `20260722000200_verifier_queue_assignment.sql` | `assigned_verifier_id` + `list_verifiers()`. | Assignment picker errors |
| 4 | `20260722000300_verification_timeline.sql` | Lets verifiers read **project-scoped** audit rows (payments/auth stay admin-only). | Timeline shows only its spine |
| 5 | `20260722000400_evidence_integrity.sql` | EXIF capture time + GPS + SHA-256 hash on MRV evidence; duplicate detection. | Degrades gracefully — upload still works |
| 6 | `20260722000500_lgu_jurisdiction.sql` | `profiles.municipality` + endorsement jurisdiction trigger. | ⚠️ **Silently** — every LGU still sees every project nationwide |
| 7 | `20260722000600_lgu_record_evidence.sql` | Attachments on LGU emissions records. | Degrades gracefully |
| 8 | `20260722000700_dpa_admin_queue.sql` | `process_data_subject_request` — the DPA queue's missing action path. | `/admin/privacy` lists, actions error |
| 9 | `20260722000800_account_suspension.sql` | `profiles.is_active` + suspension guards at `assert_can_trade`, retirement and project insert. | Suspend button errors |
| 10 | `20260722000900_admin_segregation_of_duties.sql` | No self-granted KYC level, role, KYB verification, or refund on your own transaction. | ⚠️ **Silently** — self-dealing stays possible |
| 11 | `20260722001000_aml_screening.sql` | `aml_watchlist_entries` + `aml_screenings` + record/review RPCs. | `/admin/aml` errors |

**Verify all eleven in one query** (each row should read `true`):

```sql
select 'update_my_listing'            as check, exists(select 1 from pg_proc where proname='update_my_listing') as ok
union all select 'verifier independence', exists(select 1 from pg_trigger where tgname='trg_guard_project_self_validation')
union all select 'queue assignment',      exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='projects' and column_name='assigned_verifier_id')
union all select 'timeline policy',       exists(select 1 from pg_policies where tablename='audit_logs' and policyname like 'Verifiers%')
union all select 'evidence integrity',    exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='monitoring_evidence' and column_name='content_hash')
union all select 'lgu jurisdiction',      exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='profiles' and column_name='municipality')
union all select 'lgu evidence',          exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='lgu_emissions_records' and column_name='documents')
union all select 'dpa admin rpc',         exists(select 1 from pg_proc where proname='process_data_subject_request')
union all select 'suspension',            exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='profiles' and column_name='is_active')
union all select 'admin sod',             exists(select 1 from pg_proc where proname='admin_set_kyb_verified')
union all select 'aml screening',         exists(select 1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='aml_screenings' and column_name='status');
```

> The Supabase SQL editor shows **only the last statement's result** when several
> are pasted together. Run the union above as one statement, or check each
> separately — a single-row result is not confirmation that the others passed.

**The two runtime checks that matter most**, because each is the whole point of
its feature and the thing a careless change would break:

1. A **suspended user can still download a retirement certificate.** Suspension
   blocks transacting, never access to your own records — a retirement
   certificate is ESG evidence and a platform sanction must not destroy it.
2. An **admin editing their own display name still succeeds.** The SoD guard
   compares against *current* values precisely so this keeps working; the admin
   UI submits the whole form every time.

### 0.5 🆕 2026-07-23 — profile-on-signup (✅ applied 2026-07-25)

One migration. Additive, idempotent, safe to re-run; has a rollback block in its
header.

| # | Migration | Purpose | Inert until applied? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql` | A `security definer` trigger on `auth.users` creates the profile row **inside the signup transaction**, before any session exists — plus a backfill for accounts already missing one. | ⚠️ **Silently** — email-confirmation signups get no profile, so they load blank and demoted to `general_user` |

**✅ Applied to the live project on 2026-07-25.** Run the verify query below to
confirm (`trigger_installed = true`, `users_without_profile = 0`). The client-side
resilience that pairs with it (last-known-role preservation, working retry, failure
banner) shipped the same day — see the 🆕 2026-07-25 note near the top.

**Why a trigger and not client code:** the profile was created from the browser
right after `signUp()`. That only works when `signUp` returns a session; with
email confirmation on it does not, so the client INSERT is refused by the
`profiles` RLS policy (`auth.uid() = id`) and the error is swallowed. OAuth and
phone signups never ran that path at all. A definer trigger is the only place
that can hold the invariant. The trigger always writes `general_user` — trusting
a role from signup metadata would let anyone self-register as admin — and swallows
its own errors so a failure can never block a signup.

**Verify:**

```sql
select exists(select 1 from pg_trigger where tgname = 'on_auth_user_created') as trigger_installed,
       (select count(*) from auth.users u
          left join public.profiles p on p.id = u.id
         where p.id is null) as users_without_profile;  -- expect 0 after backfill
```

Then: register a brand-new email on a project with confirmation enabled → confirm
a `profiles` row exists immediately, with the name from signup and role
`general_user`.

## 1. What changed

### 2026-07-23 — navigation → sidebar, and a login/register/role-guard audit (branch `feature-user-onboarding-ux`)

**Navigation.** Collapsed three parallel menus (top nav, avatar dropdown,
per-dashboard link directories) into a single grouped left sidebar for signed-in
users, sourced from one canonical destination table
([constants/navigation.js](../src/constants/navigation.js)). The header retains
only identity and alerts; the avatar menu is account-only; the three-line button
next to the logo opens the mobile drawer and collapses the desktop rail (the
sidebar's own collapse control was removed so there is one). Guests keep the
marketing header. Developer projects collapse to grouped one-line rows
([DeveloperProjectsDashboardView.vue](../src/views/DeveloperProjectsDashboardView.vue),
[groupDeveloperProjects.js](../src/utils/groupDeveloperProjects.js)). Dead
`UserDashboard.vue` / `UserProfile.vue` deleted. New: `AppSidebar` (rewritten),
[useSidebar.js](../src/composables/useSidebar.js), [logout.js](../src/utils/logout.js).

**Access control.** Fixed three blockers (public marketplace redirecting to login;
`super_admin` infinite-redirect; non-buying roles reaching checkout) at their root
— route `meta.public`, a shared `canonicalizeRole()` mirroring the DB, and
`disallowedRoles` on the buying routes. Removed ~450ms of hardcoded per-navigation
guard sleeps that waited on an already-resolved promise. Auth-form signals
(email-confirmation-pending, already-registered) now reported honestly; the
specialist-approval gate keys on `err.code`; storage clearing scoped to auth keys
only; the dead `canAccessRoute`/`getRoutePermissions`/`createRoleGuard` path
removed. Fixed a verifier-panel TDZ crash in
[ProjectApprovalPanel.vue](../src/components/admin/ProjectApprovalPanel.vue).
Verified every role's dashboard mounts clean in a real browser. New migration in
§0.5. **+122 tests** (543 → 665): navigation IA, sidebar render per role, project
grouping, route-access metadata, role canonicalization, auth-flow signals, and
auth-storage-key scoping.


### 2026-07-02 — server-authoritative cutover: first live sandbox pass (bug found + fixed; commit `a881294`)
The cutover money path was runtime-tested for the first time. It did **not** work
out of the box — the first purchase surfaced a hard blocker that had been latent
because this RPC path was never exercised against the live DB. Fixed and
**partially re-verified** the same session.

| Area | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug (critical)** | `process_marketplace_purchase` inserted `credit_ownership.status = 'active'`; the live `credit_ownership_status_check` allows only `'owned'`/`'retired'`/`'transferred'` → **every card/cart purchase rolled back**, webhook 500'd, intent stuck `pending`, and **PayMongo auto-disabled the webhook** after repeated failures | Fix: migration `20260702000000_fix_marketplace_ownership_status.sql` (`status = 'owned'`, matching sibling `process_wallet_purchase`). Safe — `status` is not a read filter (portfolio uses `ownership_type`; retire filters on user/project/qty) |
| **Ops** | PayMongo webhook had been auto-disabled → re-created it + reset `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; delivery restored | PayMongo has no dashboard "re-enable"; recreate or call the `/enable` API |
| **Diagnostics** | `paymongo-webhook` now records thrown handler errors to `webhook_events.error` (was silent — a failed handler just left the event at `received` and retried) | [paymongo-webhook/index.ts](../supabase/functions/paymongo-webhook/index.ts) |
| **UI** | `/upgrade` now confirms/polls the plan on return from PayMongo (`?status=success`) and shows success/pending/cancelled; previously it silently re-rendered "Free" even on a successful upgrade | [UpgradeView.vue](../src/views/UpgradeView.vue) |
| **DB** | Applied §0 `20260626000700_schema_catchup` (adds `credit_transactions → profiles` FKs); schema audit now empty → the receipt/certificate 400 join noise is gone | — |

> **Step 4 status (see [YOUR_CUTOVER_STEPS.md](YOUR_CUTOVER_STEPS.md)):**
> ✅ **A. card purchase** (settles via webhook, certificate issued, reconcile = 0) ·
> ✅ **F. subscription** (`/upgrade` → Pro via `activate_subscription`) ·
> ⬜ **B. wallet top-up** · ⬜ **C. wallet purchase** · ⬜ **D. cart (2 items)** ·
> ⬜ **E. retire credits** — **not yet tested.** The **P1 RLS lockdown stays gated**
> until B–E pass. B–E run through `process_wallet_purchase` / `ensure_wallet` /
> `retire_credits_atomic` — the webhook now surfaces any failure in
> `webhook_events.error`.

### 2026-07-01 — money edges proven + codeable backlog + admin consoles (build green, ESLint 0, 145 tests)
The money path was proven end-to-end and the remaining "built-but-not-clickable" gaps were closed.
Everything below was **runtime-verified** this session (not just build-green). Four idempotent
migrations (`20260701000000–000300`) were applied.
| Area | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Money edges** | ✅ **payout + refund proven** — KYB-gated payout settled; cart + refund reversed; `reconcile_financials()` = 0 throughout | Phase 2 now PROVEN, not just code-complete |
| Backlog | Seller **per-project earnings** breakdown on `/sales` | pure `aggregateSalesByProject` + unit tests |
| Backlog | **Server-side pagination** on the buyer purchases tab | also un-orphaned `/retire` (redirected to `/wallet`, was unreachable) |
| Phase 3 | **Structured additionality + permanence** metadata (form → trust card) | migration `…000000`; persisted across all 3 write paths |
| Phase 6 | **Saved searches + price alerts** (marketplace) | migration `…000100`; bell alert on new/cheaper match |
| Nav | Surfaced **Retire Credits** (buyers) + **Seller Earnings** (developers) in nav | both existed but were linked nowhere |
| Phase 5 | **Admin KYB-review console** (`/admin/kyb`) + **Refunds/Disputes console** (`/admin/refunds`) | migration `…000200` (admin refund RPC); were backend-only RPCs |
| Phase 2 | **Seller KYB submission form** (from the Seller Earnings gate) | completes the click-driven payout path |
| Phase 5 | **Admin KYC-level override + level list** in User Management (fixes a 400) | migration `…000300`; KYC ≠ KYB clarified |
| DPA | **`account-deletion` edge function deployed** | erasure worker live |

> All 2026-07-01 work is committed on `feature-user-onboarding-ux` and pushed. Migrations
> `20260701000000–000300` are applied on the live DB.

### 2026-06-26 — UI/UX design pass + a Submit-Project fix (build green, ESLint 0, 114 tests)
A presentation-layer polish sweep across the most-used screens, kept brand-safe (green/white
Carbonify identity) and **logic-free** except for one genuine bug fix. Every change is CSS/markup
only and revertible per-file with `git checkout`.
| Area | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Header / nav | Profile dropdown + mobile menu rebuilt into **role-aware grouped sections** (Workspace / Account / Shopping / Records / Tools / More) with icons + identity header; top-nav links got pill hover + animated underline | [Header.vue](../src/components/layout/Header.vue); routes unchanged |
| Header | Removed the name/role **text block** from the bar — now just the **bell + avatar**; name/role still shown inside the dropdown | per request |
| Page heroes | Unified the **green hero gradient** across Market, Registry, Finance Console, About to match the Marketplace hero (they were teal/light before) | [MarketDashboardView](../src/views/MarketDashboardView.vue), [RegistryView](../src/views/RegistryView.vue), [FinanceConsoleView](../src/views/FinanceConsoleView.vue), [AboutView](../src/views/AboutView.vue) |
| Profile | Brand-gradient header, **role pill** (colour-tinted per role), phone/website shown, tinted Role & Access card | [ProfileView.vue](../src/views/ProfileView.vue) |
| Admin dashboard | Gradient header, **floating stat cards with tinted icons**, green tool-card hovers (was off-brand blue), accented section headers + pill "Open Full Role Applications" | [AdminDashboard.vue](../src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.vue) |
| Project detail | Pill back-button, richer hero (overlay + zoom), accented card headers, hover lifts, listing rows, gradient "Go to marketplace" button | [ProjectDetailView.vue](../src/views/ProjectDetailView.vue) |
| **Submit Project (bug fix)** | The **Required Technical & Compliance Documents** inputs were `display:none` with no `for`/`id` and no click handler — **they were not clickable at all**. Rebuilt each as a `<label>`-wrapped **card with a plain-language description** of the document (PDD, Baseline, Additionality, Leakage, Safeguards, LGU Endorsement, Land/Lease, ECC, MOA) + an attached/required status. Clicking now opens the file picker natively | [ProjectForm.vue](../src/components/ProjectForm.vue); `handleSingleDocUpload` + refs unchanged. **Runtime-verify** an actual upload |

> ⚠️ The document-input fix is exactly the "code-complete but runtime-untested" class — those
> required-doc fields had never been clickable, so confirm a real PDF attaches on submit.

### 2026-06-26 session — features shipped (build green, ESLint 0)
| Area | What | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 5 | DPA tooling — self-service data export + account-deletion request + erasure worker | `3d14b5e` |
| Phase 4 | Edit/resubmit-after-revision loop complete (queue re-entry, verifier bell, revision badge) | `d7d0055`, `95be6f3` |
| Phase 3 | Full buyer-facing project-detail page (trust card, developer, map, docs, co-benefits) | `d993521` |
| Phase 3 | `local\|supplier` provenance badge + marketplace filter | `977ce39` |
| Phase 3 | ESG / offset report export (PDF + CSV) on the Credit Portfolio | `73f7c97` |
| Phase 3 | SDG tagging (submit form) → display → marketplace filter, end-to-end | `1ab3785` |
| Phase 5 | Admin finance console (sales/fees/payouts + book reconciliation, admin-gated RPCs) | `9790dc3` |
| Phase 5 | Provisional VAT invoices (12% PH VAT, admin-configurable tax identity) | `742305e` |
| Phase 7 | Public searchable carbon registry (`/registry`, anon-accessible) | `81792ac` |
| Phase 7 | Hot-path DB indexes | `5683731` |
| Nav/UX | Portfolio link in top nav; verifier panel scroll fix; misc | `87a5e84`, `b765b63` |
| DB | Schema-drift fixes + consolidated **catch-up** migration + read-only audit | `a99ce91`, `80416b1`, `2e00a40`, `df62627`, `a378e6f`, `4991a64` |

> Several "missing" roadmap items turned out to be **already built** (verification checklist,
> SLA aging, audit-log search) — verified, not rebuilt. The recurring theme this session was
> the live DB **lagging the migrations**; §0's catch-up + audit close that out.

### 2026-06-26 — codeable-backlog sweep (no dashboard/partner needed, build green, ESLint 0)
A pass to clear the items that could ship as pure code, with **zero new migrations**
(every feature reuses existing columns/tables) — so nothing here is blocked on the
dashboard or an external party:
| Area | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 4 | **Weighted scored rubric** on the validation checklist (Inadequate/Adequate/Strong × per-item weight → overall score + band) | Score stored in the existing `verification_assessments.checklist` JSONB; `checked` kept in sync |
| Phase 4 | **Project boundary map** — draw the location pin + boundary polygon at submit/edit | Writes `projects.geo_coordinates` + `projects.boundary` (cols already exist); detail view already rendered them. Also fixes a latent bug where **geo was never saved on create** |
| Phase 4 | **MRV reporting reminders** — due/overdue banner on the Monitoring page + deduped bell notification | Derived from `projects` + `monitoring_reports` vs admin cadence `mrv_reporting_days` (default 365); no schema change |
| Phase 8 | **Offline-capable service worker** — app-shell precache, network-first nav with offline fallback, stale-while-revalidate assets | Same-origin GET only; never caches Supabase/PayMongo/OSM |
| Phase 8 | **Mobile polish** — wide tables (finance console, seller earnings, emission factors) now scroll + 640px breakpoints | No behavior change |

> All five are **runtime-untested** (🆕) — they're committed and build-green but, like the
> rest of the session, want a real click-through. None require the §0 migrations or the
> dashboard blocker; they can be tested as soon as the app is running.

### 2026-06-26 — Phase 2–4 + backlog code sweep (after the money path was proven)
Advanced the unimplemented phases with pure-code work (build green, ESLint 0, **114 unit
tests**, +40 this sweep). Two new idempotent migrations (§0 #10–11); everything else is
additive and leaves the proven money path untouched.
| Phase | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **2 — Beta hardening** | Payment-path tests: VAT-invoice math, weighted rubric, seller-withdrawal validation | Locks the money/feature logic against regression (the silent-webhook-bug class) |
| **3 — Scale** | Composite hot-path indexes + `getUserPurchaseHistoryPage()` (server-side paginated history with exact count) | Additive; existing marketplace loader untouched |
| **4 — Credibility** | Double-claim **serial guard** (unique `certificates.registry_serial`) + **`/market` public dashboard** (`public_market_stats`) | Mirrors the registry's anon pattern |
| **Backlog** | Buyer **portfolio gain/loss vs market** (real value, replaces the fake `×25` placeholder) | Pure `computePortfolioPnl` + cost basis surfaced from `purchase_price` |

> ⏳ Still open in the backlog (not yet built): seller per-project earnings/issuance history,
> saved-search/price alerts. The `/market` dashboard and paginated history are not yet linked
> in the nav (reachable by URL); wiring is a small follow-up.

### 2026-06-25 cycle — Branding & UX (build green)
- ✅ **Rebrand EcoLink → Carbonify** across ~105 files (app, views, services, config, docs, `index.html`,
  `manifest.json`, edge functions). Internal storage keys + applied DB migrations intentionally preserved.
- ✅ **Logo** — new `public/carbonify-logo.png` wired into header, login, register, mobile menu, favicon, manifest.
- ✅ **Login fix** — surfaced the real "Email not confirmed" error; root cause was unconfirmed accounts +
  `[auth.email] enable_confirmations` (handled in `config.toml` / dashboard).
- ✅ **Project Map fix** — map never rendered (Leaflet init ran before the container existed); also added a
  stacking context so the map can't paint over the sticky header. Uses free OpenStreetMap tiles (no key).
- ✅ **Legal policies** — split the single modal into real **Terms / Privacy / Carbon Credits** docs with the
  pre-production disclaimer, matching `POLICY_AND_USER_AGREEMENT.md`.
- ✅ **Profile menu** — moved About / Saved / Cart into the profile dropdown (About for every role).
- ✅ **LGU Tools** — fixed input box-sizing/overflow + doubled row spacing on the MSW calculator.
- ✅ **Submit Project** — removed the developer's "Price per Credit" field; the **verifier sets the price**
  at review (also fixed a latent bug where editing would blank a verifier-set price).

### Money-path verification progress
- ✅ CLI logged in + linked to project `fmngptolarydbgrtltnd`.
- ✅ Deployed edge functions: **`process-payouts`** (was missing) and **`paymongo-checkout`** (refreshed).
- ✅ Applied the 3 pending migrations in the SQL Editor: `project_comments`, `app_settings`,
  `verification_checklist` (fee-aware purchase RPC confirmed live).
- ✅ PayMongo webhook registered: `…/functions/v1/paymongo-webhook`, event `checkout_session.payment.paid`.
- 🐛 **Found + fixed a critical webhook bug** ([paymongo-webhook/index.ts](../supabase/functions/paymongo-webhook/index.ts)):
  it read the event name from the wrong field (`data.attributes.event`) and compared to the wrong value
  (`checkout.payment.paid`), so **every payment would be silently ignored** — buyer pays, nothing settles.
  Now reads `data.attributes.type` and accepts `checkout_session.payment.paid`; also fixed `sessionId`/`amount`
  extraction. **Code fixed; not yet deployed (see blocker).**

### Verifier workflow — Phase 4 (this cycle, committed)
- ✅ **Developer ↔ verifier comment thread** — was already built; unblocked by the applied `project_comments`
  migration. Added **comment notifications** ([notificationService.js](../src/services/notificationService.js))
  so the other party is alerted via the bell (reviewer→owner, owner→reviewers, internal notes→reviewers only).
- ✅ **Verifier price input** — the verifier now sets the price per credit at validation
  ([ProjectApprovalPanel.vue](../src/components/admin/ProjectApprovalPanel.vue)); persisted to
  `projects.credit_price` (blank falls back to the category default). Completes the submit-project change.

> Commits: `f39cf51` (rebrand + fixes + comment notifications); verifier price input committed after.

### Phase 5 — DPA tooling (data export / account deletion) — this cycle, code-complete 🆕
- ✅ **Self-service data export** — **Profile → Privacy & Data** tab → "Download my data"
  gathers everything we hold for the signed-in user (profile, transactions, holdings,
  certificates, activity, …) into a single JSON file. RLS scopes every read to the user;
  the source list is drift-proof (skips missing tables/columns).
  ([dataPrivacyService.js](../src/services/dataPrivacyService.js),
  [PrivacyDataPanel.vue](../src/components/account/PrivacyDataPanel.vue))
- ✅ **Account-deletion request** — same tab; a typed-`DELETE` confirmation records a
  request in the new `data_subject_requests` table (owner-or-admin RLS), idempotent per
  user, cancellable while pending.
- 🆕 **Erasure worker** — [account-deletion edge function](../supabase/functions/account-deletion/index.ts)
  deletes the auth user (cascades profile-keyed personal data; retains legally-required
  financial rows). **Code-complete; deploy when the dashboard blocker below is cleared.**
- Migration: [20260626000000_dpa_data_subject_requests.sql](../supabase/migrations/20260626000000_dpa_data_subject_requests.sql)
  (apply via SQL Editor). Fulfils the Privacy Policy's §2.5 promise. Build green, ESLint 0.

---

## 2. ✅ Money-path blocker — CLEARED (2026-06-26)

The Supabase CLI `403 "necessary privileges"` was sidestepped via the **Dashboard**: the 3
secrets (`PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY`, `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAYOUT_WORKER_SECRET`) were set
and the **bug-fixed `paymongo-webhook` was deployed** from the function editor. A real sandbox
purchase (PayMongo test card `4343 4343 4343 4345`, on the Vercel **preview** deploy of
`feature-user-onboarding-ux`) **settled cleanly** — `reconcile_financials()` = **0 rows**.

**Still needs the same Dashboard flow when you get to them:**
- Deploy the **`account-deletion`** edge function + set `ACCOUNT_DELETION_SECRET` (so DPA
  deletion requests can be processed).
- The money-path **edges** (subscription, payout, refund) — no new deploy, just app/SQL steps
  (runbook Step E).

> Testing setup used: pushed `feature-user-onboarding-ux` to GitHub, linked the repo to the
> `ecolink` Vercel project, and ran `vercel deploy` for a **preview** URL (production `main`
> intentionally untouched). The webhook posts to the public Supabase functions URL, so the
> preview front-end is enough to drive the test.

### 🧭 Proposed expansion features (scoped 2026-07-07) — implemented vs not

Seven product-expansion features were proposed (national biomass registry / MRV / investor
data-room positioning for the PH market). This is their **real status** against the current
codebase — roughly ~60% is already built as extensions of existing modules, not greenfield.

> ⚠️ **The "code-complete" labels below are FEATURE-level, and they hide missing sub-items.**
> For the honest bullet-by-bullet picture — including the buyer history, offtake agreements, farmer
> carbon participation, and MRV farmer/hectare metrics that are **not built** despite their features
> being marked shipped — read **[EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md](EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md)**. Where the
> two disagree, the audit is right: it was checked against the code.

| # | Feature | Status | What exists today | Gap to build |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Project Registry page** | 🆕 **code-complete (2026-07-08)** — migration #21 pending apply + runtime check | [ProjectDetailView.vue](../src/views/ProjectDetailView.vue) + `projects` table carry **GPS** (`geo_coordinates` + `boundary` GeoJSON, drawn on the map), **methodology** (now captured on the submit form), **feedstock**, **capacity** (+unit), **development status** (`projects.status`), **expected reductions** (`estimated_credits`), **documents** (real [`project-documents` bucket](../supabase/migrations/20260707000000_project_documents_bucket.sql): PDD/feasibility/MRV), co-benefits, additionality/permanence; **project developer** shown via the Developer profile card | ✅ shipped: `feedstock`/`capacity`/`capacity_unit` cols ([mig #21](../supabase/migrations/20260707000200_project_registry_fields.sql)) + form subsection + detail rows. **⚠️ Weaker than claimed (5/8 bullets):** methodology is a **free-text input, not an enum** — Verra/Gold Standard/Puro/ISO are only placeholder hint text, so nothing can filter or group by it; **"development status" is the validation-workflow status**, not a project lifecycle stage (no such column); **MRV reports are not a registry document type**. **Remaining:** methodology enum, lifecycle field, MRV docs, runtime-verify |
| 2 | **Carbon Asset Management** | 🆕 **code-complete (2026-07-08)** — no migration needed; runtime-unverified | Credit **serials**, issued/pending **pool**, **sold** (`credit_transactions`), **retired** (atomic multi-row), **buyer history**, **inventory** (`credit_ownership`), [CreditPortfolioView](../src/views/CreditPortfolioView.vue), [SellerEarningsView](../src/views/SellerEarningsView.vue) | ✅ shipped: developer **asset-ledger view** [`/developer/ledger`](../src/views/CarbonAssetLedgerView.vue) rolling up estimated/issued/pending/sold/retired/inventory (+value) per project via pure [`aggregateAssetLedger`](../src/services/assetLedgerService.js) over `projects`/`project_credits`/`credit_transactions`/`verified_emission_reductions`/`credit_retirements` (MRV tables drift-safe). 6 unit tests. **⚠️ Missing vs spec: BUYER HISTORY** — the sales query never selects `buyer_id`, so a developer sees aggregate sold totals but not *who* bought. That was the stated ERPA/institutional-buyer rationale. **Remaining:** buyer history (no migration needed) + runtime click-through |
| 3 | **Biomass Marketplace** (feedstock RFQ) | 🆕 **code-complete (2026-07-08)** — migration #22 pending apply; runtime-unverified | Marketplace was **credits only**; `supplier_orders` is external-registry fulfillment, not feedstock | ✅ shipped: [mig #22](../supabase/migrations/20260708000000_biomass_marketplace.sql) (`biomass_products` + `biomass_rfqs` + 3 RPCs), [`biomassService`](../src/services/biomassService.js), public browse [`/biomass`](../src/views/BiomassMarketplaceView.vue) + RFQ modal, KYB-gated [`/biomass/sell`](../src/views/BiomassSellView.vue), [`/biomass/rfqs`](../src/views/BiomassRfqsView.vue) buyer+supplier tabs. 11 unit tests, notifications wired. **⚠️ `black_pellets` is not a first-class feedstock type** (only `wood_pellets`); it can only be entered as free-text "Other biomass", so it can't be browsed or filtered — a named RRCC product. One-line fix. **Remaining:** black pellets + runtime click-through |
| 4 | **MRV Dashboard** | 🆕 **roll-up shipped (2026-07-08)** — no migration; runtime-unverified. Satellite/IoT still external (deferred) | [MRV module](../supabase/migrations/20260604010000_create_mrv_module.sql) + [MonitoringReportView](../src/views/MonitoringReportView.vue) + [mrv.js](../src/constants/mrv.js) capture biomass, energy, CO₂ avoided/removed, hectares, methodology factors | ✅ shipped: developer **roll-up dashboard** [`/developer/mrv-dashboard`](../src/views/MrvDashboardView.vue) — verified/proposed/pending tCO₂e, monthly proposed-vs-verified trend, per-metric activity sums, per-project reporting-compliance vs cadence — via pure [`aggregateMrvDashboard`](../src/services/mrvDashboardService.js) over `monitoring_reports`/`verified_emission_reductions`/`monitoring_activity_data` (drift-safe), reusing PortfolioChart/CategoryChart. 6 unit tests. **⚠️ Weakest feature vs spec (0/8 bullets fully).** Missing: **biomass collected** (no such metric key), **farmers participating** + **plantation hectares** (the dashboard never reads `farm_parcels`/`farmer_deliveries` — they exist since mig #25 and are a join away, no migration), and **CO₂ avoided vs removed is never split** (only a combined tCO₂e). Energy generated appears only if a report happens to carry `energy_kwh`. **Deferred:** satellite + IoT feeds (external API + cost) |
| 5 | **Investor Portal** | 🆕 **code-complete (2026-07-08)** — migration #24 pending apply; runtime-unverified | `buyer_investor` role + document/data-room foundation + [FeatureGate](../src/components/ui/FeatureGate.vue) plan gating existed | ✅ shipped: Pro-gated [`/investor`](../src/views/InvestorPortalView.vue) — cross-developer **pipeline** of validated projects, projected value, **funding gap**, and a per-project **financial model (IRR/NPV/payback)** via fresh pure [`investorAnalytics`](../src/services/investorAnalytics.js) (11 tests). New `FEATURES.INVESTOR_PORTAL` (Pro/Business). [mig #24](../supabase/migrations/20260710000000_project_financials.sql) persists `capex`/`opex`/`project_lifetime_years`/`funding_target`/`funding_raised` (the form collected CAPEX/OPEX but dropped them — now wired into a new "Financials" form subsection). **⚠️ Missing vs spec: OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS** — zero functional code repo-wide (no table, field, or UI), so every IRR rests on an *assumed* credit price rather than contracted revenue. The "data room" is a document **count badge + link-out** to the project page, not an in-portal viewer. **Remaining:** offtake/ERPA model, a real data room, developers enter financials, runtime-verify |
| 6 | **Farmer Portal** | 🆕 **code-complete (2026-07-09)** — migration #25 pending apply; runtime-unverified | No `farmer` role existed; `profiles.role` has **no CHECK constraint** — the real gates were `assign_user_role()`'s allow-list and `role_applications.role_requested`'s CHECK | ✅ shipped: `farmer` role end-to-end (constants, `roleService` permissions map, `userStore.isFarmer`, `createFarmerGuard`, `/farmer` landing, applyable at `/apply`, assignable in User Management); [mig #25](../supabase/migrations/20260711000000_farmer_portal.sql) (`farm_parcels` + `farmer_deliveries` + 3 RPCs); [`farmerService`](../src/services/farmerService.js) (23 tests); [`/farmer`](../src/views/FarmerPortalView.vue) parcel register + delivery logging with proof upload; buyer **Deliveries tab** on [`/biomass/rfqs`](../src/views/BiomassRfqsView.vue) (confirm → mark paid). Farmers bypass the KYB listing gate. **⚠️ Missing vs spec (3/6 bullets): CARBON PARTICIPATION** (a farmer sees sacks and pesos — `farmer_deliveries` has no link to credit issuance, and the word tCO₂e appears nowhere in the portal) and **TRAINING** (no module at all). **Plantation "monitoring" is a static register** — expected yield is stored but never reconciled against actual delivered quantity, despite deliveries carrying `parcel_id`. **Remaining:** carbon participation, actual-vs-expected yield, training, runtime click-through |
| 7 | **AI Project Assistant** | 🟡 **interface only (2026-07-09)** — no backend, no LLM dep | No LLM integration (no `anthropic`/`openai` dep) | ✅ shipped: discoverable [`/assistant`](../src/views/AiAssistantView.vue) preview — chat surface, role-aware example questions, planned-capability panel. **Composer is disabled and nothing is sent anywhere; no answers are generated.** Linked in the profile dropdown under Insights, ungated. **Remaining:** the actual Supabase edge fn → Claude API with tool access to project/credit/MRV tables (external API cost); decide then whether to Pro-gate it via `FEATURES.AI_ASSISTANT` |

> **All seven features have shipped code, but none is 100% against its spec bullets.** The next pass
> is *depth, not breadth* — see [EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md](EXPANSION_FEATURE_AUDIT.md) for the
> ranked close-out list. The top three need **no migration**:
> 1. **MRV: farmers participating + plantation hectares** — join `farm_parcels`/`farmer_deliveries`
>    into `aggregateMrvDashboard`. Turns the "biggest differentiator" into one.
> 2. **Asset ledger: buyer history** — select `buyer_id`, join `profiles`. Serves the ERPA use case.
> 3. **Black pellets** in the feedstock dropdown — one line.
>
> Then: farmer carbon participation → methodology enum + lifecycle status → **offtake/ERPA model**
> (largest new build; converts projected into contracted revenue) → CO₂ avoided/removed split →
> **#7 AI backend** (Claude API edge fn, external cost) → satellite/IoT (deferred, external) →
> training content.

### Schema drift — catch-up tooling (this cycle)
The live DB predates the tracked migrations and has been applied piecemeal, which
repeatedly surfaced as "missing column" 400s and broken PostgREST joins. Two new files:
- [schema_catchup_audit.sql](../supabase/diagnostics/schema_catchup_audit.sql) — **read-only**;
  run it in the SQL Editor to list every expected table/column/FK/function that is **missing**
  on this DB. Empty result = fully current.
- [20260626000700_schema_catchup.sql](../supabase/migrations/20260626000700_schema_catchup.sql) —
  one **idempotent** migration that ensures all drift-prone columns + the credit_transactions→
  profiles FKs + the widened status constraint. Apply it to fix the column/FK/join class of
  drift in one shot. If the audit reports a missing **table**, apply that table's own migration.

## 4. Next steps

Feature work and the money cutover are **done**. The priority now is **security close-out
before real users**, then launch. The authoritative, prioritized plan is
**[GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md](GO_LIVE_ROADMAP.md)** (implemented vs not, by priority, with a printable
go/no-go gate); the security detail is **[dev/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md](dev/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md)**.

### A. 🔴 P0 — security close-out (do before ANY real user pays)
1. Apply migration `20260703000300` (lock `profiles.role`/`kyc_level`) → verify a normal user
   can't self-promote to admin, and admin/verifier/KYC flows still work.
2. Apply `20260703000400` (retirement identity = `auth.uid()`) → retest flow E, reconcile = 0.
3. Redeploy `send-approval-email` with `verify_jwt=true` (close the open email relay).
4. Redeploy `paymongo-checkout` to require the verified JWT (stop trusting client `user_id`) →
   re-run the 6 money flows, reconcile = 0 each.
5. Enable email confirmation + custom SMTP; confirm `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS` unset + secrets set.
6. Remove the legacy/demo code paths (raw checkout branch, legacy webhook branches, `demo`
   purchase, dead wallet mutators) → re-run flows.
7. **Book an independent penetration test** before switching to live PayMongo keys.

### B. Capture the work — ✅ done
- **PR #2 is MERGED** (2026-07-07) — `feature-user-onboarding-ux` → `main` (merge `d3ee30d`),
  ~121 commits. `main` now carries the full app. A follow-up **PR #3** (merge `fb14e42`) removed
  23 dead files. `gh` is authenticated. The branch and `main` are in sync (0 unmerged commits).
  Note: merging code does **not** apply the pending DB migrations (§0 #17–20) — do those separately.

### C. Remaining work — external party or ops/legal (parallel track)
- **Real registry/supplier fulfillment** — needs an external registry partner (Carbonmark/Cloverly/Patch).
- **AML screening** — needs a sanctions/PEP data vendor.
- **Backups/PITR · connection pooling · observability (Sentry) · CSP · rate limiting** — ops/infra + keys.
- **Legal entity · licensed PSP/EMI · BIR registration · DPO/AMLA · accredited verifier (VVB)** — business/legal.
- **Favicon set** — generate square favicons from the logo (`scripts/create-favicons.js`).

---

## 5. Notes for whoever picks this up
- All session work is **committed** on `feature-user-onboarding-ux` (build green, ESLint 0).
- **Apply the §0 migrations** before testing; the schema had drifted behind all session.
  Run [schema_catchup_audit.sql](../supabase/diagnostics/schema_catchup_audit.sql) anytime to
  check (empty = current). As of the last audit only `supplier_orders` + 2 certificate columns
  were missing — both covered by the §0 list.
- VAT invoices are **provisional** (not BIR-accredited until the entity is registered).
- The public registry, finance console, and DPA RPCs are **SECURITY DEFINER** and self-gate
  (anon for the registry; `is_admin()` for finance; `auth.uid()` for DPA) — the underlying
  tables stay RLS-protected.
- PayMongo webhooks can't reach `localhost` — run the money-path test against the deployed app or a tunnel.
- Don't use `supabase db push` here (known schema drift) — apply migrations via the SQL Editor.
